        <h3>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different
            lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.[1][2] Due
            to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from different
            positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.

            To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, astronomers use the
            principle of parallax. Here, the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to
            the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit.[a] These distances form the
            lowest rung of what is called "the cosmic distance ladder", the first in a succession of methods by which
            astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other distance measurements
            in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.</h3>
